# End-to-End Business Intelligence Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project walks through the full workflow of a data analyst — from messy raw data to actionable insights delivered through a polished dashboard. The goal is to show how I can take a dataset, clean and structure it, analyze key metrics, and turn those insights into recommendations a business can act on.  

---

## What I Set Out to Do
- Understand the data and define meaningful KPIs.  
- Track metrics like **revenue trends**, **customer churn**, **lifetime value (LTV)**, and **conversion rates**.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** to make the data easy to explore.  
- Generate **actionable recommendations** that could help a business grow.  

---

## Dataset
- Publicly available dataset (retail transactions or SaaS usage).  
- Stored in `/data/raw/`.  
- All sensitive information removed or anonymized.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Cleaning, structuring, and aggregating data.  
- **Python (pandas, numpy):** Wrangling and feature engineering.  
- **Power BI / Tableau:** Interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **Git/GitHub:** Version control and project tracking.

## What I Did
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration:** Loaded the dataset in Python, handled missing values, standardized formats, and prepared it for analysis.  
2. **SQL Analysis:** Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL and wrote queries to calculate and summarize KPIs.  
3. **Dashboard Creation:** Built interactive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau to visualize trends and patterns.  
4. **Insights & Recommendations:** Documented findings and suggested actions based on the data.
